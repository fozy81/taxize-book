# Links {#links}

The `ft_links` function makes it easy to get URLs for full text versions of articles. You can for instance only use `fulltext` to pass DOIs directly to `ft_links` to get URLs to use elsewhere in your research workflow. Or you may want to search first with `ft_search`, then pass that output directly to `ft_links`. 

## Usage {#links-usage}

```{r}
library(fulltext)
```

List backends available

```{r}
ft_links_ls()
```

You can pass DOIs directly to `ft_links`

```{r}
(res <- ft_links('10.3389/fphar.2014.00109'))
res$frontiersin
```

Or search first

```{r}
(res1 <- ft_search(query='ecology', from='entrez'))
```

Then pass the output of that directly to `ft_links`

```{r}
(out <- ft_links(res1))
```

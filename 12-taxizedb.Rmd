# taxizedb {#taxizedb}

[taxizedb][] arose out of a few things. First, some of the data sources used in `taxize` also provide complete dumps of all their data, usually as SQL databases. Second, when a user has a lot of operations to do, `taxize` can leave the user feeling like there could be a faster solution. That thing is `taxizedb`.

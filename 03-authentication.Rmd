# Authentication {#authentication}

Some data sources require authentication. Here's a breakdown of how to do authentication by data source:

* **BMC**: BMC is integrated into Springer Publishers now, 
and that API requires an API key.  Get your key by signing up at 
<https://dev.springer.com/>, then you'll get a key. Pass the key to a 
named parameter `key` to `bmcopts`. Or, save your key in your `.Renviron` 
file as `SPRINGER_KEY`, and we'll read it in for you, and you don't 
have to pass in anything.
* **Scopus**: Scopus requires an API key to search their service. Go to 
<https://dev.elsevier.com/index.html>, register for an account, 
then when you're in your account, create an API key. Pass in as variable 
`key` to `scopusopts`, or store your key under the name 
`ELSEVIER_SCOPUS_KEY` as an environment variable in `.Renviron`, and 
we'll read it in for you. See `?Startup` in R for help.
* **Microsoft**: Get a key by creating an Azure account at 
<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions>, 
then requesting a key for **Academic Knowledge API** within 
**Cognitive Services**. Store it as an environment variable in your 
`.Renviron` file - see [Startup] for help. Pass your 
API key into `maopts` as a named element in a list like 
`list(key = Sys.getenv('MICROSOFT_ACADEMIC_KEY'))`
* **Crossref**: Crossref encourages requests with contact information 
(an email address) and will forward you to a dedicated API cluster 
for improved performance when you share your email address with them.
<https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#good-manners--more-reliable-service>
To pass your email address to Crossref via this client, store it 
as an environment variable in `.Renviron` like `crossref_email = name@example.com`

None needed for **PLOS**, **eLife**, **arxiv**, **biorxiv**, **Euro PMC**, or 
**Entrez** (though soon you will get better rate limtits with auth for Entrez)

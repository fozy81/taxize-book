# Authentication {#authentication}

Some data sources in `taxize` require authentication. Here's a breakdown of which ones require authentication, and how to do authentication by data source:

* **Tropicos**: Request a Tropicos API key from <http://services.tropicos.org/help?requestkey>
* **EOL**: EOL requires an API key. You can pass in your EOL api
key in the function call like `sci2comm('Helianthus annuus', key="<your eol api key>")`. You can also store your EOL API key in your .Rprofile file as `options(EOL_KEY = "<your eol api key>")`, or just for the current session by running `options(EOL_KEY = "<your eol api key>")` in the console.
* **NCBI Entrez**: From NCBI's docs: "E-utils users are allowed 3 requests/second without an
API key. Create an API key (in your account at
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/>) to increase your e-utils limit to 10
requests/second. Contact our help department (eutilities@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
if you need higher throughput. Only one API Key per user. Replacing or
deleting will inactivate the current key. Refer to documentation
(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/>) for more."
* **IUCN**: IUCN requires an API key. Request an API key at <http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/token>

Save your API keys as the following names either as R options or environment variables:

* Tropicos: 'TROPICOS_KEY'
* EOL: 'EOL_KEY'
* IUCN: 'IUCN_REDLIST_KEY'
* ENTREZ: 'ENTREZ_KEY'

We'll read in your keys if we can find them in either R options or environment variables. See `?Startup` in R for details on how to store R options or environment variables. 

We encourage users to use environment variables rather than R options because they are more standard across programming languages and computing environments.

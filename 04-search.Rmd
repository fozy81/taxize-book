# Search {#search}

Search is what you'll likely start with for a number of reasons. First, search functionality in `fulltext` means that you can start from searching on words like 'ecology' or 'cellular' - and the output of that search can be fed downstream to the next major task: fetching articles.

## Usage {#search-usage}

```{r}
library(fulltext)
```

List backends available

```{r}
ft_search_ls()
```

Search - by default searches against PLOS (Public Library of Science)

```{r}
res <- ft_search(query = "ecology")
```

The output of `ft_search` is a `ft` S3 object, with a summary of the results:

```{r}
res
```

and has slots for each data source:

```{r}
names(res)
```

Get data for a single source

```{r}
res$plos
```

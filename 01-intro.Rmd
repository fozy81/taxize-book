## User interface

Functions in `fulltext` are setup to make the package as easy to use as possible. The functions are organized around use cases:

* Search for articles
* Get full text links
* Get articles
* Get abstracts
* Pull out article sections of interest

Because there are so many data sources for scholarly texts, it makes a lot of sense to simplify the details of each data source, and present a single user interface to all of them.

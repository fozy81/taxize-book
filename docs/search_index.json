["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 User interface", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 User interface taxize is designed around making certain use cases easier - abstracting away the details of what each taxonomic data source requires for that use case. The use cases currently covered in taxize: Taxonomic identifier from a taxonomic name Taxonomic name from a taxonomic identifier Taxonomic name from a vernacular name Vernaculr name from a taxonomic name Taxonomic hierarchy/classification from identifier or name Children of an identifier or name Immediate names above an identifier or name All taxa downstream to a certain rank from identifier or name Taxonomic name synonyms from identifier or name Lowest common taxon and rank for an identifier or name Resolve taxonomic names, i.e., fix spelling errors Make a taxonomic tree from identifiers or names "],

["authentication.html", "Chapter 4 Authentication", " Chapter 4 Authentication Some data sources in taxize require authentication. Here’s a breakdown of which ones require authentication, and how to do authentication by data source: Tropicos: Request a Tropicos API key from http://services.tropicos.org/help?requestkey EOL: EOL requires an API key. You can pass in your EOL api key in the function call like sci2comm('Helianthus annuus', key=&quot;&lt;your eol api key&gt;&quot;). You can also store your EOL API key in your .Rprofile file as options(EOL_KEY = &quot;&lt;your eol api key&gt;&quot;), or just for the current session by running options(EOL_KEY = &quot;&lt;your eol api key&gt;&quot;) in the console. NCBI Entrez: From NCBI’s docs: “E-utils users are allowed 3 requests/second without an API key. Create an API key (in your account at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/) to increase your e-utils limit to 10 requests/second. Contact our help department (eutilities@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) if you need higher throughput. Only one API Key per user. Replacing or deleting will inactivate the current key. Refer to documentation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/) for more.” IUCN: IUCN requires an API key. Request an API key at http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/token Save your API keys as the following names either as R options or environment variables: Tropicos: ‘TROPICOS_KEY’ EOL: ‘EOL_KEY’ IUCN: ‘IUCN_REDLIST_KEY’ ENTREZ: ‘ENTREZ_KEY’ We’ll read in your keys if we can find them in either R options or environment variables. See ?Startup in R for details on how to store R options or environment variables. We encourage users to use environment variables rather than R options because they are more standard across programming languages and computing environments. "],
